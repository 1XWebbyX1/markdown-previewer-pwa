// To find what this can do, view our sample text below or start editing in the editor and see the results rendered in the previewer.

### Here's the sample to show you some cool stuff:

Heres some code, \`<div></div>\`, between 2 back ticks.

\`\`\`
// this is multi-line code:

function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
  if (firstLine == '\`\`\`' && lastLine == '\`\`\`') {
    return multiLineCode;
  }
}
\`\`\`

You can also make text **bold**... whoa!
Or _italic_.
Or... wait for it... **_both!_**
And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.

There's also [links](./images/react.svg'), and
> Block Quotes!

And if you want to get really crazy, even tables:

Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.

- And of course there are lists.
  - Some are bulleted.
     - With different indentation levels.
        - That look like this.


1. And there are numbered lists too.
1. Use just 1s if you want!
1. But the list goes on...
- Even if you use dashes or asterisks.
* And last but not least, let's not forget embedded images:

 # HI!
 ## You just found a Markdown Previewer

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

To see what this can do,
Start writing plain text in the editor or load our sample text by clicking on the back icon at the top right corner of the screen and quickly see the text rendered in the Markdown Previewer.

Here is a tip--
♥ You can switch the theme using the toggle button at the top right corner of the screen ♥


Important Note: The state will be saved until editor is reloaded.
